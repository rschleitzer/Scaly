    <prose>Choose expressions pattern match on union types, allowing different code paths based on which variant is present.

    <tests id = choose-on-variants title = "Choose on Variant Construction">
        <prose>Choose can match directly on constructed variants.

choose Option.None: when v: Some: v else 0<expect>0

    <tests id = choose-binding title = "Choose with Binding">
        <prose>When a variant carries a value, the value can be bound to a name.
