Scaly
=====

Welcome to https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly[_Scaly_], the _self-scaling programming language_.

Overview
--------

Scaly is a safe parallel programming language with the following features:

- enables implicit and safe parallel and distributed code execution where data dependencies allow
- safety against program crashes, exploits, data races and concurrency problems
- performance comparable to C/C++
- easy programming like in common mainstream languages

Documentation
-------------

The link:book/[_Scaly Book_] is your one-stop source for learning how to write programs in Scaly 
and how to compile and run them using the reference implementation, and for understanding 
the main design points of Scaly. The Scaly Book is also available as a 
link:book/ScalyBook.html[single page version] and in link:book/ScalyBook.pdf[PDF format].

Building
--------

Currently, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting[self-hosting] implementation of the 
Scaly https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly/tree/master/scalycpp[compiler] outputs C\++ code, and 
https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly/tree/master/scalypp[runtime support and standard library code]
is implemented in C++ as well.

The C++ version of the compiler which was generated by itself is stored together with
the Scaly sources and is used for 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28compilers%29[bootstrapping].

You can build Scaly on Ubuntu 15.10 taking the following steps:

1. Install http://codelite.org/[CodeLite] and run the Setup Wizard.

2. Clone the github repository:

  git clone https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly.git
    
3. Open `scaly.workspace` and build.
